My father taught me the difference between knowing the name of a bird and knowing the bird. He would say, "See that bird? It's a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany, it's called the 'Halzenfugel,' and in Chinese, it's called a 'Chung Lin,' and so on. Now, you know all the names for that bird, but you know absolutely nothing about the bird itself. You only know about humans and what they call it. Now, let's look at the bird."

He would point out its feathers, why it pecks at them, its patterns of flight. He taught me to observe. The name didn't tell you anything about the bird. I learned that knowing names is not the same as knowing.

Later, in physics, I saw the same thing. People would use big words like "energy" or "entropy," but they couldn't explain what they really meant in simple terms. They just knew the name. My approach was always to try and translate it back to basics. If I couldn't explain it to a first-year student, I didn't really understand it myself. The real knowledge is in the understanding of the relationships, the causes, and the principles, not in the memorization of the vocabulary.
